#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the design, development, deployment , testing and maintenance of a software product. It plays a crucial role in the technology industry by leading to the creation of software products that power our modern life including communication and commerce.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming language: This includes Fortran and deployment of languages into customizable version.
Software Engineering: It became a discipline in the 1960's and now has branches of specialization like front end, back end and mobile app development.
Advent of Structured Programming: This started around 1970's.
Rise of agile methodologies: It envisages a flexible and itinerant approach to coding and good for maintaining update to programs. It began in the 2000's


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile methodologies require rapid prototyping and . A good case scenario is developing a mobile game with frequent iterations while Waterfall involves coding with well-defined requirements and minimal changes expected. Example is an e-commerce website with fixed features.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.
System Architect: Designs the overall structure and architecture of software systems.
UI/UX Designer: Creates user interfaces and designs user experiences for software applications.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
It detects bugs early, reducing overall testing time
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
It identifies integration-related bugs and errors.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
It ensures the system is usable and meets acceptance criteria.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
It makes your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need."

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a vague prompt is telling the AI to talk about the foods of the world. To improve it, we tell the AI to explain common food types in a region of the world.
The improved prompt is more effective because it is  focused on a specific section not generalizing.
